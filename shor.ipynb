        "Multi-Controlled Gates: Decomposing gates with many controls (needed for adders/multipliers) increases gate count and circuit depth.\n",
        "\n",
        "Resource Scaling: While the framework handles variable N, the required qubits (~4n) and especially the gate count (~O(n^3)) grow significantly, demanding substantial simulation resources for larger N.\n",
        "\n",
        "Future Work: Verify and potentially optimize the CMM/CMA circuits, implement more efficient multi-controlled gate decompositions, test scaling on larger N from the semiprimes list, explore QFT approximations.\n",
        "\n",
        "8. Conclusion\n",
        "This project successfully implements the structure of Shor's quantum algorithm using QuantumRingsLib. It incorporates genuine quantum arithmetic principles, including QFT-based adders and explicit modular reduction logic. The successful factorization of N=15 validates the overall approach and the implemented components for this specific case, demonstrating the potential for factoring larger numbers on capable quantum simulators or hardware."
